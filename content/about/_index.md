Hey, I'm Sam Newby! I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer at Tails.com where I spend most of my time working with Python and JavaScript. In previous roles I have worked with PHP, JavaScript and a little bit of Go.

Outside of work I have a real passion for learning (sounds weird, I know), but I love learning about other languages, frameworks, and libraries this doesn't mean I then move onto using these other tools but I love to understand what makes Svelte different to Vue or what the strengths and weaknesses of the Crystal language are. Currently, I'm focused on learning Rust and seeing if I can maybe integrate it into side projects or build some new side projects with Rust.

Alongside learning Rust, I'm also working on building Blockchain applications with Reach and Algorand. Why you ask? Because I do believe in the future of crypto but it's also really interesting, Web3 and Blockchain apps bring a whole new challenge for any Software Engineer and I love that challenge!
