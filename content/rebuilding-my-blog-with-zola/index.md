Rust baby! ðŸ¦€ 

Rust is one of the hottest topics in software engineering right now. Everyone is either adopting it for their next project or wants to but is stuck writing PHP instead, no hate on the PHP community, I used to be one of you! So, I wanted to rebuild my blog for the forty-eigth time in my short career because honestly why the hell not? I'm going to be active for a couple of months, write a few articles no one is going to read, tweet about them, then abondon it and drop off the face of the earth like I got a knock on the door in the middle of the night. And this time I decided to build it with a SSG written in Rust called Zola. Honestly, Zola is great, templating engine is just magical, it's BLAZINGLY fast like everything nowadays and it's built in Rust.

Not going to bore you with load of details, but here is a rough overview of how it all happened:
1. I started by deciding to rebuild my blog, got to make that crucial decision first.
2. Looked in my wardrobe for "I'm jumping on the bandwagon hat" but I couldn't find it. 
3. Found a couple of great tutorials on how to get Zola working with PostCSS so I could use TailwindCSS because I love having 21 classes on my divs!
4. Built it and styled it, then rewrote all the HTML again, restyled it again and repeated the styling cycle another 3 times.
5. Deployed to Cloudflare because why not?

Overall, this blog post has been pretty successful I think. I've made over 5 bad jokes, told you about my new love for Zola and that I lost my hat.
